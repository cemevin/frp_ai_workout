# FRP AI Workout
Infinite FRP Workout generated by ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion XL (Clipdrop). 
- creates a randomly generated story based on Forgotten Realms.
- Prompts the user to complete some exercises before progressing with the story.
- Generates an image based on the current scene.
- Keeps a chat history so if the user continues the session later on, it provides the summary of what happened before.

# How to use:
- Obtain API keys from OpenAI and Clipdrop
- You can also use DALL-E but the image results aren't very good
- Install node.js and npm to your pc, and do "node app.js" and you should be able to test it in localhost:8080.
