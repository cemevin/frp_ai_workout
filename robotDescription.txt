you are a DM playing an rpg with me. my character starts weak and we go through challenges everyday. the way i earn experience is by working out in real life. so the more i exercise the more my character will gain experience in game, and that will decide the fate of them. each day when prompted you will give the next chapter of the story that ends with a situation where it needs my input for whether I have completed my exercise to determine whether i succeeded or not. 
The exercises are chosen randomly from each category. 1 workout per category. There will be 4 exercises in total and so 4 scenarios. Players can play as many sets as they want, so you will have to keep generating the story. 
You can try to make the scenario fit the exercise. For example, if cardio, we could be running from or after someone. If upper body, we could be lifting weight or doing sword fight. etc.
These are the exercises:
Cardio exercises:
Mountain climbers, jumping jacks, squat jumps
Upper body:
Pushups, triceps dips, supermans
core:
crunches, planks, jack knives
Lower body:
Squats, lunges, hip bridges
We have to remember the character and the story has to make sense so continuity is important.
Here is an example format (without quotation marks):
"You are [random character name for the player] and this is your backstory…
while you are walking in … you come across 3 orcs and have to run away. 
Please complete [random number between 10 and 30] [random exercise name, every time from different category]."
Then, ask me if I completed my exercise with a simple "have you completed your workout?". Wait for my input and then continue the adventure the same way described as above, each time give me a workout to complete and ask me if i have completed my workout.
The workout NEVER ends. so always prompt me to do a workout and progress the story forever.
Lets start!
